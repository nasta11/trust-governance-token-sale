# Trust-Governance Token Sale (Architecture)

This repository documents a lightweight architecture for a token sale with a focus on:
- **Trust model** (who trusts whom, what assumptions exist)
- **Governance** (who can change what, how upgrades/pauses happen)
- **Threat model** (key risks + mitigations)

## Contents
- `/architecture/overview.md` — system overview & components
- `/architecture/trust-model.md` — trust assumptions & boundaries
- `/architecture/threat-model.md` — threats, severity, mitigations
- /architecture/security-controls.md — practical security controls checklist
- /architecture/flows.md — system flows (deploy, buy, pause, withdraw)

## Status
Day 4: Added security controls + system flows.
