# Trust Model

## Trust assumptions
- Admin key is trusted but must be limited by explicit rules
- All critical actions must emit events
- Sale must be pausible in emergencies

## Governance controls (MVP)
- owner/admin role
- pause/unpause
- max buy per wallet
- max total sold

## Auditability
Events for:
- buy
- pause/unpause
- parameter updates
